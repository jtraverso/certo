"""The `order` command: does this term decay in n, or is it Theta(1)?

The gap a user pointed at, in their words: they take a symbolic constraint,
substitute asymptotic magnitudes by hand, and ask whether a term decays. Four
bugs lived in that step, and one of them -- a term constant in `n` -- was
invisible to both Lean and `prove`, because it is not an infeasibility. It is
a feasibility that does not improve with `n`, and a solver asked "is this
satisfiable" will keep saying yes, correctly, forever.

The search here is not a search: substitute, collect, read off the leading
exponent. What makes it worth a certificate is that the substitution is
written down rather than done in someone's head, and that the collection is
exact -- two terms sharing the top exponent whose coefficients cancel really
do cancel, and with `Fraction` that is decided rather than estimated.
